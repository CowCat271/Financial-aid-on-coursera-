I'm applying for financial aid for the course \"Course name\" because I do not have any special source of income, I don't earn enough money, and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career.\n",

Hopefully this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and new technologies, and I'm eager to work and to advance in my career.\n",
